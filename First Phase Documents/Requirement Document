Requirement gathering:

Observation: 
We went to the Lakehead website, and looked into applying for residence. The website seems to support most of everything 
asked for our project. However, it looked like it wasnâ€™t designed to support mobile devices, and the user experience could 
be better. It could have the links logically organized throughout the webpages, instead of a sidebar. Plus, contacting the 
manager is not built into the website to automatically email them.
